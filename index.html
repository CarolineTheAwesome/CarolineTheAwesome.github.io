    <p>The time required for males and females to reach sexual maturity differs by gender and by geographic location. Male dolphins reach sexual maturity at anywhere from 10-15 years of age, with females reaching sexual maturity at 5-13 years. But, obtaining sexual maturity is more a function of size, not age. Females reach sexual maturity when they are about 85-95% of their adult body length. Female dolphins are believed to spontaneously ovulate, not having a set ovulation cycle. Typically, they will ovulate anywhere from one to six times per year. Ovulation often is stimulated by the presence of a male dolphin or may occur in a mother following the loss of her calf. Dolphins are not monogamous. They will have several breeding partners in a given reproductive season. Other than humans and chimpanzees, dolphins are the only other animal that engages in sexual activity for reasons other than reproduction and not timed specifically with female estrus. Male Bottlenose dolphins will perform sex acts with other dolphin species as well as with other males of their own species. Male-to-male sexual activity (called "intromission") among dolphins is often a sign of bonding, recreation or even aggression.
